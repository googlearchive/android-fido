Android FIDO U2F API Sample
===========================

A basic app showing how to register and authenticate FIDO U2F
Security Keys using the FIDO U2F API.

FIDO U2F API is used for devices running Android L (API level 21)
or newer.

Introduction
------------
The Fast Identity Online Universal 2nd Factor (FIDO U2F) API is now available.
It provides U2F physical security key support to apps, in accordance with the standards defined by
the FIDO Alliance.

This API should be accessed from U2fApiClient entry point. For example, here is how to get an
instance of it:
```java
private U2fApiClient mU2fApiClient;
â€¦
mU2fApiClient = Fido.getU2fApiClient(this /* calling activity */);

```

U2fPendingIntent can be used to launch U2F request. Here are different ways for registration and
sign respectively to get a U2fPendingIntent from the entry point.
For a registration request:
```java
Task<U2fPendingIntent> result =
     mU2fApiClient.getRegisterIntent(registerRequestParams);

```

For a sign request:
```java
Task<U2fPendingIntent> result =
     mU2fApiClient.getSignIntent(signRequestParams);

```

launchPendingintent(Activity, int) can be used to launch the U2F request.
```java
result.addOnSuccessListener(
     new OnSuccessListener<U2fPendingIntent>() {
       @Override
       public void onSuccess(U2fPendingIntent u2fPendingIntent) {
         if (u2fPendingIntent.hasPendingIntent()) {
           // Start a U2F registration request.
           u2fPendingIntent.launchPendingIntent(this, REGISTER_REQUEST_CODE);
           // For a U2F sign request.
           // u2fPendingIntent.launchPendingIntent(this, SIGN_REQUEST_CODE);
         }
       }
     });

 result.addOnFailureListener(
     new OnFailureListener() {
       @Override
       public void onFailure(Exception e) {
           // fail
       }
     });

```


Handling the result:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  if (resultCode != RESULT_OK) {
    // Something went wrong
  }

  switch(requestCode) {
    case REGISTER_REQUEST_CODE:
      RegisterResponseData registerResponse = (RegisterResponseData) data
          .getParcelableExtra(Fido.KEY_RESPONSE_EXTRA);
      // Do something useful
      break;
    case SIGN_REQUEST_CODE:
      SignResponseData signResponse = (SignResponseData) data
          .getParcelableExtra(Fido.KEY_RESPONSE_EXTRA);
      // Do something useful
      break;
    default:
      // Something went wrong
  }
}
```
